# DNS Benchmark Tool

This PowerShell script allows you to benchmark multiple DNS servers to check their latency and packet loss. It generates a detailed HTML report with DNS server performance, including medals for the fastest servers.

## Features
- Tests multiple DNS servers (e.g., Google, Cloudflare, OpenDNS).
- Measures latency and packet loss for each DNS server and domain combination.
- Outputs results in an easy-to-read HTML format.
- Ranks servers with a gold, silver, and bronze medal based on latency.
- Easily extendable to add more DNS servers or domains.

## Requirements
- PowerShell (Windows or PowerShell Core)
- Internet connection

## Usage

1. Copy/paste in PowerShell
2. Clone the repository or download the script.
3. Open PowerShell and run the script.
